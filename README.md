This project has been developed in accordance of MCS-205 Ecommerce course guideline.

[Lenskart](lenskart.com) is an ecommerce website that primarily sells eyewear, we analyzed the site and figured different shortcomings that could be improved.

### 2 **Products and services**

### 2.1 **Business model** 

------
Our business model is eCommerce. E-Commerce business model is an upgradation of the traditional brick-and-mortar business model. It focuses on selling products by creating a web-store on the internet. Although [Lenskart](lenskart.com) is **Bricks and clicks** model, we are unable to provide physical presence to our stores so we have to stick with eCommmerce model. 












### 2.1.1 **Competitive landscape**

------
Our website provides different sorts of eyewear products which has quite a number of competetive companies like [Coolwinks](coolwinks.com) , [LiveOptical](liveoptical.com) and [Lenskart](lenskart.com) obviously is another one. All of these companies have strong online presence and a great advertisement team working 24/7 to reach a greater customer base. However, all such sites have one thing in common i.e. unclearity and non-transperancy of products on their respective website. These sites contain so many products and different categories that for a simple user it becomes chaotic to find the best product. To lure customers some sites like [Lenskart](lenskart.com) claim to have 3D online tryon but in reality these functions are terrible and do not work properly. On top of this there is also higher price range for customers. Offline reltailers do a better job than such sites in providing perfect  products to customers in a suitable price range.    














### 2.2 **Revenue model**

------

Our revenue model is Direct Sales Model. The direct sales model is the most commonly used revenue earning model adopted by the e-commerce companies. It involves setting up a store in an online marketplace or a self-owned website and shipping the goods as and when the money is paid by the customer. However, Online payment is not available at the moment but it will soon be facilitated.

------
Security is vital but variable according to the functionality of the web application. Some companies might have a greater concern for multi-factor authentication than others. However, one cannot completely rule out attempted break-ins. Therefore, a good web security is always a must.
Mass assignment is known to be a vulnerability when a web application’s ORM(object-relational mapping) interface is exploited to change the certain type of information in the database, which in any case shouldn’t be allowed to be changed by the user. These types of information include the session keys, cookie data, passwords, permissions, and admin access.
Hijacking is to vehicles, as Clickjacking is to clicks. They are also known as “UI redress attacks”, where the attacker renders a concealed layer on your website, in the hope of deceiving the client into clicking on to it, may it be a button, or link, which redirects it to another page, owned by another application, domain, or both.
Framekillers are the solution to the problem of ClickJacking. They are written in JavaScript with the intended functionality of checking if the current window is the main window.
The most important credential to authenticate and recognize a user is the password, which is why we need robust ways to store it in an encrypted way.
